Hi! I am @tyiop794. I am interested in becoming a systems programmer, but am currently building projects to help me learn programming fundamentals.
These projects will be in this repository! I will also contribute to any projects; currently, I have most experience in Python, but I would also 
be willing to provide documentation to any project that needs it.
